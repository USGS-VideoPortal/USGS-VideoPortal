# USGS-VideoPortal
This repository is a place to track development for the US Geological Survey (USGS) Video and Photography Portal.  The portal contains U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) video and photography of the seafloor off of coastal California and Massachusetts, and aerial imagery of the coastline along segments of the Gulf of Mexico and mid-Atlantic coasts. These data were collected as part of several USGS Coastal and Marine Geology Program Seafloor Mapping projects and Hurricane and Extreme Storm research. The portal is available [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7JH3J7N).
